### `npm i`

Install all the dependencies for the project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### Deployment

I have deployed this Web-App on [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) it's really easy with power of firebase. You just have to create a project in firebase.
And for deployment you have to install firebase in your app directory. After building your app for the production you just have to run these commands:
<br>
#### `firebase login`
#### `firebase init`
#### `firebase deploy`

choose the proper project from your firebase then choose only build folder for deploying the web-app.
